							<h3>About</h3>									
								<p>The ability to collect, analyze, and integrate data from large number of diverse data sources has offered unprecedented opportunities to study human behaviors and their relationship to various types of systems and services. Mobile phone data and the content generated by hundreds of millions of users on social media such as Twitter, or Facebook, present continuous data streams of human social activities, and offer a unique chance to understand the structure and dynamics of social and information behavior in various situations. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the related areas of big data, internet computing and crisis information management to meet the growing challenges in efficient disaster management. We aim to foster a productive  collaboration between computer/information scientists, public policy and urban planners, government officials, and other interested participants to discuss issues and challenges related to disaster  management. This includes  theoretical, methodological, ethical, and political questions in regard to the study of large-scale emergency related data and intelligent systems. A particular objective of the CIC-DM'16 is  to bridge the gap between the methods of scalable data management, data mining, and the smart applications to improve emergency responses. We aim to  provide a platform for the exchange of ideas, identification of important and challenging problems, and discovery of possible synergies. Our hope is that this workshop  will spur vigorous discussions and encourage collaboration between the various disciplines resulting in joint projects and grant submissions.
